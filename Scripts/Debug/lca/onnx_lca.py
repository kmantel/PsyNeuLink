        An implementation of a Leaky Competing Accumulator as a layer. Each call to forward of this module only
        implements one time step of the integration. See module LCAModel if you want to simulate an LCA to completion.

        Args:
            threshold: The threshold that accumulators must reach to stop integration. If None, accumulators will
                never stop integrating even when the pass the threshold.
            leak:  The decay rate, which reflects leakage of the activation.
            competition: The weight to apply for inhibitory influence from other activations. Positive values lead
                to inhibitory effects from other accumulators.
            self_excitation: The weight to apply for the scaling factor for the recurrent excitation
            non_decision_time: The time that should be added to reaction times to account for stimulus encoding and
                response generation. This parameter shifts the results reactions times by and offset. This parameter
                is not actually used by LCALayer since the forward method only computes a timestep at a time. However,
                this is a common LCA model parameter so it should be stored with the others. It is added to final
                reaction time generated from LCAModel.forward.
            activation_function: The non-linear function to apply to pre activities to get activities. This is
                torch.relu by default, but can be any callable.
            noise: The standard deviation of the Gaussian noise added to each particles position at each time step.
            time_step_size: The time step size (in seconds) for the integration process.
