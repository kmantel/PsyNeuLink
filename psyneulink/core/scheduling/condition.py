.. _Condition_Overview

Overview
--------

`Conditions <Condition>` are used to specify when `Components <Component>` are allowed to execute.  Conditions
can be used to specify a variety of required conditions for execution, including the state of the Component
itself (e.g., how many times it has already executed, or the value of one of its attributes), the state of the
Composition (e.g., how many `TIME_STEP` s have occurred in the current `TRIAL <TimeScale.TRIAL>`), or the state of other
Components in a Composition (e.g., whether or how many times they have executed). PsyNeuLink provides a number of
`pre-specified Conditions <Condition_Pre_Specified>` that can be parametrized (e.g., how many times a Component should
be executed). `Custom conditions <Condition_Custom>` can also be created, by assigning a function to a Condition that
can reference any Component or its attributes in PsyNeuLink, thus providing considerable flexibility for scheduling.

.. note::
    Any Component that is part of a collection `specified to a Scheduler for execution <Scheduler_Creation>` can be
    associated with a Condition.  Most commonly, these are `Mechanisms <Mechanism>`.  However, in some circumstances
    `Projections <Projection>` can be included in the specification to a Scheduler (e.g., for
    `learning <Process_Learning>`) in which case these can also be assigned Conditions.



.. _Condition_Creation:

Creating Conditions
-------------------

.. _Condition_Pre_Specified:

*Pre-specified Conditions*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Pre-specified Conditions <Condition_Pre-Specified_List>` can be instantiated and added to a `Scheduler` at any time,
and take effect immediately for the execution of that Scheduler. Most pre-specified Conditions have one or more
arguments that must be specified to achieve the desired behavior. Many Conditions are also associated with an
`owner <Condition.owner>` attribute (a `Component` to which the Condition belongs). `Scheduler`\\ s maintain the data
used to test for satisfaction of Condition, independent in different `execution context`\\ s. The Scheduler is generally
responsible for ensuring that Conditions have access to the necessary data.
When pre-specified Conditions are instantiated within a call to the `add` method of a `Scheduler` or `ConditionSet`,
the Condition's `owner <Condition.owner>` is determined through
context and assigned automatically, as in the following example::

    my_scheduler.add_condition(A, EveryNPasses(1))
    my_scheduler.add_condition(B, EveryNCalls(A, 2))
    my_scheduler.add_condition(C, EveryNCalls(B, 2))

Here, `EveryNCalls(A, 2)` for example, is assigned the `owner` `B`.

.. _Condition_Custom:

*Custom Conditions*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom Conditions can be created by calling the constructor for the base class (`Condition()`) or one of the
`generic classes <Conditions_Generic>`,  and assigning a function to the **func** argument and any arguments it
requires to the **args** and/or **kwargs** arguments (for formal or keyword arguments, respectively). The function
is called with **args** and **kwargs** by the `Scheduler` on each `PASS` through its `consideration_queue`, and the result is
used to determine whether the associated Component is allowed to execute on that `PASS`. Custom Conditions allow
arbitrary schedules to be created, in which the execution of each Component can depend on one or more attributes of
any other Components in the Composition.

.. _Condition_Recurrent_Example:

For example, the following script fragment creates a custom Condition in which `mech_A` is scheduled to wait to
execute until a `RecurrentTransferMechanism` `mech_B` has "converged" (that is, settled to the point that none of
its elements has changed in value more than a specified amount since the previous `TIME_STEP`)::

    def converge(mech, thresh):
        for val in mech.delta:
            if abs(val) >= thresh:
                return False
        return True
    epsilon = 0.01
    my_scheduler.add_condition(mech_A, NWhen(Condition(converge, mech_B, epsilon), 1))

In the example, a function `converge` is defined that references the `delta <TransferMechanism.delta>` attribute of
a `TransferMechanism` (which reports the change in its `value <Mechanism_Base.value>`). The function is assigned to
the standard `Condition()` with `mech_A` and `epsilon` as its arguments, and `composite Condition <Conditions_Composite>`
`NWhen` (which is satisfied the first N times after its condition becomes true),  The Condition is assigned to `mech_B`,
thus scheduling it to execute one time when all of the elements of `mech_A` have changed by less than `epsilon`.

.. _Condition_Structure:

Structure
---------

The `Scheduler` associates every Component with a Condition.  If a Component has not been explicitly assigned a
Condition, it is assigned a Condition that causes it to be executed whenever it is `under consideration <Scheduler_Algorithm>`
and all its structural parents have been executed at least once since the Component's last execution.
Condition subclasses (`listed below <Condition_Pre-Specified_List>`)
provide a standard set of Conditions that can be implemented simply by specifying their parameter(s). There are
six types:

  * `Generic <Conditions_Generic>` - satisfied when a `user-specified function and set of arguments <Condition_Custom>`
    evaluates to `True`;
  * `Static <Conditions_Static>` - satisfied either always or never;
  * `Composite <Conditions_Composite>` - satisfied based on one or more other Conditions;
  * `Time-based <Conditions_Time_Based>` - satisfied based on the current count of units of time at a specified
    `TimeScale`;
  * `Component-based <Conditions_Component_Based>` - based on the execution or state of other Components.
  * `Convenience <Conditions_Convenience>` - based on other Conditions, condensed for convenience

.. _Condition_Pre-Specified_List:

*List of Pre-specified Conditions*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    The optional `TimeScale` argument in many `Conditions <Condition>` specifies the unit of time over which the
    Condition operates;  the default value is `TRIAL <TimeScale.TRIAL>` for all Conditions except those with "Trial"
    in their name, for which it is `RUN`.

      Equivalent to `Condition(func, *args, **kwargs)`

    * `WhileNot` (func, *args, **kwargs)
      satisfied whenever the specified function (or callable) called with args and/or kwargs evaluates to `False`.
      Equivalent to `Not(Condition(func, *args, **kwargs))`

    * `AtRunNStart`
      satisfied on `TRIAL <TimeScale.TRIAL>` 0 of the specified `RUN` counted using 'TimeScale`


.. Condition_Execution:

Execution
---------

When the `Scheduler` `runs <Schedule_Execution>`, it makes a sequential `PASS` through its `consideration_queue`,
evaluating each `consideration_set <consideration_set>` in the queue to determine which Components should be assigned
to execute. It evaluates the Components in each set by calling the `is_satisfied` method of the Condition associated
with each of those Components.  If it returns `True`, then the Component is assigned to the execution set for the
`TIME_STEP` of execution generated by that `PASS`.  Otherwise, the Component is not executed.
